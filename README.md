# Alfred HTTP

An [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow for searching HTTP status codes. The workflow displays the
codes along with their reason-phrase (e.g. "Not Found") and a short sentence
describing the function of this code.

Hitting return opens a browser window with the proper RFC for that status code.
