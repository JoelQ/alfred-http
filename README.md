# Alfred HTTP

An [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow for searching HTTP status codes. The workflow displays the
codes along with their reason-phrase (e.g. "Not Found") and a short sentence
describing the function of this code.

Hitting return opens a browser window with the proper RFC for that status code.

## Installation

* Download the [latest
release](https://github.com/JoelQ/alfred-http/releases/latest)
* Open finder and doubleclick the `HTTP.Statuses.alfredworkflow` file
